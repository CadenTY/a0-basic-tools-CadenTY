# Covid Cases and Vaccinations
#### By: Caden Henson
###### 1/14/2022

### What is this Report for?
This report is to show and bring awareness to the ever **increasing COVID-19 cases** (primary data) being reported with the introduction of both the Delta and Omicron variants as of recent. This report also contrasts and shows the **average vaccination rate** (secondary data) in an attempt to show the effort of the government to reduce the spread of the virus. For my primary and secondary data visualizations, I have included a graph showing the change in number of cases over the past 6 months and a chart showing the average vaccination rate over the same time period.

### Data Visualizations:
***The Graph below is showing the [6 month percent change of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/10/world/omicron-covid-testing-vaccines) between July 2021 - January 2022 by the CDC.***

***The Graph below is showing the [rate of vaccination in the US daily on average](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html) between January 2021 - January 2022 also by the CDC.***

### Primary Data Visualization Description:
In the first graph embedded above regarding the spread and effects of COVID-19 over a 6 month period, we can see three graphs, each indicating a different subject. _The one in red shows the percent increase of cases, the one in yellow shows the percent increase in hospitalizations, and the one in grey shows the percent increase in deaths._ The value given on the y-axis to measure the change is a percentage value of the previous winter peak in cases. From this graph we can see that in the late part of last year and early part of this year there is a huge percent increase in specifically cases of which is around _300% of last winter's peak_.

- **Who**: Scientists from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention.

- **Date**: 1/12/2022

- **Stakeholders**: The intended audience for this visualization are the citizens of the United States as this data graph gives an accurate representation of how the virus is spreading in recent times. These citizens are also the ones who will be both directly and indirectly impacted from this because the rate of spread will dictate how the government reacts which can cause things to shutdown again and for people to be more at risk in general.

- **Interests**: The goals and interests for the visualization are to spread awareness and educate the general population about this virus.

- **Key Facts**: One thing that can be learned from the visualization is  that being vaccinated doesn't make you immune to the virus. Millions around the world are vaccinated and yet cases are still skyrocketing. Getting vaccinated does help but you still have to take the necessary precautions and treat the virus seriously.

### Data Feminism: What I Learned
To start off we must define what exactly data feminism is. In the textbook, data feminism is defined as:
> A way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought.

From doing this assignment, I not only learned and reinforced my knowledge on the basic tools and foundations of coding for this course but also learned what data feminism is and the importance of its prevalence in today's society. I now know how to use Atom, Git, and Git-Hub and am looking forward to future assignments. :smile:
